1. Choose weather station from Weather data: https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html

The weather station we used are:

Toronto City ONTARIO
TORONTO BUTTONVILLE A ONTARIO
TORONTO LESTER B. PEARSON INT'L A ONTARIO
Ottawa CDA RCS

Give each station a code:
Toronto City ONTARIO----1
TORONTO BUTTONVILLE A ONTARIO----2
TORONTO LESTER B. PEARSON INT'L A ONTARIO----3
Ottawa CDA RCS----6

2. The value of weather_key is concatenation of station code and date. For example, the weather_key for ottawa on 2020/01/17 is 620200117.
This is done in Excel via 'concatenate(COL1, COL2)'

3. For missing values， here is the solution:
- All missing 'snow_on_ground' and 'total_recipitation' are filled with 0.
- all missing temperature are filled with mean value of the day before and after of the missing date.

   - right click and choose 'import'
   - in the pop-up box select the csv file that are data staged.
